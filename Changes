=item 0.13

if any method that needs an ACL manager uuid, does not get one, the underlying
C code will do a sec_acl_get_manager_types, using the first one returned.

DCE::ACL::entry->entry_info now deals with foreign_user and foreign_group

started cleaning and moving *.t scripts into t/ so we can 'make test'

DCE::ACL::entry->add now checks to make sure the entry does not already exist

Added DCE::ACL::handle->new_list method

Renamed classes in DCE::ACL package, will not disturb any existing code

Added DCE::Registry->domain method
$domain = $rgy->domain("user"); #returns 0
$domain = $rgy->domain("group"); #returns 1

Added aliases for DCE::Registry->domain_*
$rgy->p; #domain_person
$rgy->g; #domain_group
$rgy->o; #domain_org

If DCE::Registry->site_binding_get_info is called in a scalar context,
only the cell_name is returned

If any DCE::Registry->pgo_*_to_* method is called in a scalar context,
the status value will not be returned e.g.
$uuid = $rgy->pgo_name_to_id($uuid)

All the DCE::Registry->*_bind* method now default to "" for the cell_name
argument and &sv_undef for the auth_info argument
DCE::Registry->site_open* methods now default to "" for cell_name
methods can be invoked as simply:
($rgy, $status) = DCE::Registry->site_bind;

when $aclh->get_manager_types is called in a scalar context, 
only the $manager_types array reference is returned.

when $aclh->get_printstrings is called in a scalar context, 
only the $prinstrings array reference is returned.

added DCE::ACL->delete method

is passed
