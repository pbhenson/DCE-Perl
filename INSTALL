You may need to change the 'LIBS' attribute in the Makefile.PL file.

According to Paul B. Henson <henson@acm.org>:

The correct configuration for Solaris is to compile DCE-perl with *only*
-ldce, and then recompile perl itself including at least the following
libraries:

-ldce -lsocket -lnsl -lthread -lm


FYI, for Digital Unix 4.0, you only need '-ldce'.

For Digital Unix 3.2, you need '-ldce -lpthreads -lmach -lc_r'.

---

Then in *this directory* type:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test (optional, see t/README)
make install

The wonderful MakeMaker will take care of the subdirectories.

The test suite is not complete, nor is the documentation, however, 
if you are familiar with the DCE security APIs and/or have your
reference manuals close by, the *.t files will serve as decent examples.

For comments, questions, bug-reports, announcements, etc. subscribe to
the DCE-Perl mailing list <dce-perl@lists.csupomona.edu> by sending mail to:
majordomo@lists.csupomona.edu
with a body consisting of:
"subscribe dce-perl"

When sending a bug report, please including the following information:

output of any make errors

output of perl -V
 
DCE-Perl package version

DCE vendor and version
