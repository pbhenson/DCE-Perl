The DCE-Perl package provides an OO Perl interface to the DCE security APIs.  

The perl implementation is somewhat different from the C API:
o It takes advantage of perl's namespace packages, dropping prefixes 
  such as sec_rgy_, sec_login_, etc.  

o Stuctures such as the login_context or registry_context are held in
  blessed objects which know what namespace to look for methods in, 
  DCE::Login, DCE::Registry, etc.  

o Output arguments that are not needed by the underlying
  C functions are not passed into perl method calls, rather, they are 
  returned by the method as a list.
  However, anything that is needed for input that will change outside of 
  the method call such as a sec_rgy_cursor_t will be passed into the 
  method call as a reference.

The interface is not complete, but here is the breakdown so far:

o DCE::Registry 
  The sec_rgy_* functions
  This class is-a DCE::rgybase where constants from rgy*base.h live 

o DCE::Login 
  The sec_login_* functions
  This class is-a DCE::login_base where constants from sec_login_*.h live 

o DCE::ACL
  The sec_acl_* functions
  
o DCE::Status  
  This module attempts to help make sense of status codes

o DCE::UUID
  Misc uuid functions

KNOWN BUGS

----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO

o Better documentation and examples

o Complete sec_rgy_*, sec_login_* and *_acl_* interfaces.
  If there is a function missing you'd like to see implemented or would
  like to implement and contribute to DCE-Perl, drop a line.
