DCE-Perl was a Perl module providing access to the OSF DCE APIs from Perl
scripts. The project was originally initiated by Doug MacEachern in the late
1990's while he was at the OSF Research Institute and later taken over by Paul
B. Henson when Doug left the OSF. It is likely no longer of any practical use,
but is archived here for posterity and historical interest.
