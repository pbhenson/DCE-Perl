This is the test-suite for DCE-Perl

certain tests require that you have a valid login context
certain tests also require the caller's password, such as
sec_rgy_acct_add

It's recommended that you dce_login as cell_admin, then to 
run tests that require a password, you may:

1) set the environment variable DCE_PERL_TEST_PW
2) edit the scripts
3) do nothing, the tests will simply be skipped
